= Collect More Feedback and Never Worry about Data Limits =

Our flexible solutions allow retailers of all sizes to collect and analyze customer feedback without ever worrying about a data limit. That’s why all subscriptions to the Online Buyer Survey include unlimited access to basic data. Bizrate Insights will never charge you for the number of surveys you send out or the total customer responses you receive.

= Track the Entire Customer Journey =

Understand how your business is performing across the entire customer journey. The Online Buyer Survey covers the end-to-end shopping experience by engaging customers at two critical points: the point of sale and post-fulfillment. This unique approach helps ensure feedback is coming from verified buyers right when their experiences are top of mind.
The Point-of-Sale survey covers the experience leading up to the moment a customer clicks the checkout button. Three days after the anticipated delivery date of their order, the customer is emailed the Fulfillment survey covering the shipping experience and product satisfaction.

= Discover All the Customer Insights without Any of the Data Analysis =

You don’t need to be a data scientist or have an in-house team of analysts to get the most out of your survey results.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
=Can I customize the point-of-sale invitation?=
There are several standard (free) versions of the point-of-sale invitation available. If a retailer prefers that the invitation have its own look and feel, or one that is merely different from what Bizrate offers, then retailers can create their own graphic for the invitation if it conforms to the size specifications of 500 x 455 pixels, functionally indicates an acceptance of the invitation with a click, and is approved by Bizrate Insights. (Fee applies.)

=Do popup blockers prevent the survey invitation from rendering?=
If a pop-up blocker is present on a consumers' computer, then Bizrate's buyer survey invitation will render in a DHTML format (a pop-in). No change to the code needs to be made by retailers for this functionality; it is already built into Bizrate's code.

=Can I customize Bizrate's code?=
Bizrate® Insights does not condone nor support customization of the buyers' survey code beyond what is provided by Bizrate. Requests for customization should be submitted to Bizrate through a Bizrate Insights account manager or bizrateinsights@bizrate.com.

=Can I customize the survey?=
YES! Custom questions and custom formatting can be added to the standard survey as paid services. Please contact your Bizrate Insights account manager or email us at bizrateinsights@bizrate.com.

=How does the standard order fulfillment invitation email look?=
Three days after a consumer has indicated (on the point-of-sale survey) that they expect to receive their order, Bizrate emails the consumer an invitation to take a short survey about order receipt. The subject line for this email is “Thanks for your MerchantName Purchase! How'd it go?”. If the consumer does not respond to this invitation, then 5 days later, Bizrate issues one reminder email.

=How does Bizrate Insights lead the industry in survey response rate?=
After completing each survey, respondents are offered a reward worth up to $100 for their submission. Rewards include subscription-based services, such as popular magazine titles.
